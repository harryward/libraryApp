### Phase 2
Additional Questions:

* ability for someone to administer the autocomplete lists (particularly to remove anything that's garbage or offensive) 
	- This is probably around 2 hours of work
* related ... a stop words list that would detect whether someone's trying to enter swears into the system and scolds them for it 
	- Another 2 hours - The way to handle this would be a profanity filter, iâ€™ll just have to find a nice list of bad words and then not allow anything with those words. 
* an admin panel to enter actual locations as a string. 
	- About 1 hour, 2 hours if you want to make locations dynamic to location
